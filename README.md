# NYT-news-feed
This project is a small terminal app that allows users to see a curated selection of news stories from the New York Times. The app works by a user selecting up to 5 key words or phrases. Every day at a scheduled time the app will present a user with up to 3 news articles per category for them to view.

This app was created to solve the problem of having to sort through news feed that I was not interested in. Every morning the app can be launched and my personal news feed will be generated on the topics that I want to read about.

This app uses the Beautiful Soup Python package to create a webscrapper.
